    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like, shape(n_channels, n_samples)
        Multichannel recording data.

    window_length : int
        Number of samples to be used in the computation of the connectivity.

    overlap : float
        Percentage of the ``window_length`` by which the window will overlap when
        sliding forward.

    pairs : array-like or `None`
        - If an `array-like` is given, notice that each element is a tuple of length two.
        - If `None` is passed, complete connectivity will be assumed.


    Returns
    -------
    indices: array - like, shape(n_windows, start_offset, end_offset, n_channels, n_channels)
        Indices of pairs.
